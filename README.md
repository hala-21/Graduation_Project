# 🩺 ECG Health Monitor & AI Chatbot (Graduation Project)

This repository contains two main components developed for our final-year engineering project:

1. **🧠 ECG Classifier**: A deep learning model (`cdae_classifier.h5`) trained to detect health anomalies from ECG signals using a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE).
2. **💬 AI Chatbot (Groq API)**: A command-line chatbot interface built with LLaMA 3 using the free-tier Groq API, enabling natural language interaction with an AI assistant (`main.py`).

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── cdae_classifier.h5   # Pretrained model for ECG signal classification
├── main.py              # Terminal-based chatbot using Groq's LLaMA 3 API
└── README.md            # Project documentation

## note:
i have updated another version of main.py file which is the chat file as a new version of llm that serve a japaneses language learners
